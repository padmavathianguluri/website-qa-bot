    "text": "RPA Services \u2013 ScriptBees RPA Service What is RPA? RPA is an automation technology that enables companies to avoid redundant tasks in a digital environment. RPA involves bots, software programs that can mimic various assignments performed by any human employee. Assignments such as data entry in CRM systems, automated invoicing, text recognition, and more. The key elements of RPA can be found in the abbreviation. R \u2014 Robotic Robotics defines the special algorithm or a software bot that can execute any task. Similar to industrial robots, RPA bots follow predetermined rules to emulate user interactions. For example, distributing incoming support tickets between the support team. P \u2014 Process Process defines the sequence of steps for any task to be accomplished. For example, a support manager needs to handle different types of incoming inquiries and respond to them based on their request. Providing the same information for common inquiries requires extra resources and attention to ensure successful customers. RPA bot can replace the extra resource and performs the above sequence just like a real person. A \u2014 Automation Automation can reduce human participation and perform the tasks as mentioned in the sequence. RPA can reduce human resource participation and can work, manage an enormous amount of data at lightning-fast speeds 24/7. RPA is a powerful technology that can assist human resources, enhance the customer experience, and boost digital transformation. Watch RPA Bots Automating VolunteerMark Where can RPA be used? RPA can be implemented in different industries, such as finance, insurance, and healthcare. Irrespective of the company size, RPA technology can benefit businesses with process automation. Areas where RPA tools have proved themselves: Customer service \u2022 After-hours customer support \u2022 Handling feedback \u2022 Sending notifications \u2022 Updating client\u2019s profiles \u2022 Real-time updates on purchase status Financial services \u2022 Extracting billing information \u2022 Processing financial transactions \u2022 Invoicing \u2022 Preparing data for audits \u2022 Accounting reconciliation Human resources \u2022 Employee surveys Onboarding \u2022 Managing payrolls, compensations, and other benefits \u2022 Handling compliance \u2022 Time record validation IT \u2022 Backups \u2022 Data migration \u2022 Automated testing of sites and applications \u2022 Managing events \u2022 Security & compliance monitoring Procurement \u2022 Order validation \u2022 Purchase planning \u2022 Processing of returns \u2022 Managing contracts Sales and marketing \u2022 Updating information in a CRM \u2022 Campaign management \u2022 Reporting \u2022 Quoting \u2022 Performing follow-ups and post-sale requests Why Us \u201cScriptBees\u201d and \u201cElectroNeek\u2019s\u2019\u2019 together provide flawless RPA services which reduce human intervention and enhance your customer experience.

    "text": "Infrastructure Automation \u2013 ScriptBees Infrastructure Automation Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process where infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) managed with code and software development techniques such as version control and continuous integration. IaC is necessary for regular DevOps practices and used in conjunction with Continuous Delivery. IaC allows DevOps teams to test applications in production-like environments early on in the development cycle. The developers, and system administrators as well, interact with infrastructure methodically, and at a scale, rather than manually setting up and configuring resources with cloud\u2019s API model help. Engineers can, therefore, interface with infrastructure with code-based tools to help and treat both infrastructure and application code similarly. Infrastructure and servers can now be deployed swiftly with standardized patterns, updated with the latest patches/versions, or duplicated in repeatable ways. Infrastructure Modules Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) enables users to provide an isolated sector of a public cloud network, thereby creating a private virtual network over which they have complete control. Users will have complete control over private IP addresses, creating subnets, in addition to configuring route tables and network gateways. Other benefits include Disaster Recovery, Multiple Connectivity Options, Secured Features, Extend their Datacenter to Cloud, Network Topologies, and Hybrid Applications among others. Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) allows users to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications easily, using Kubernetes on AWS. Amazon EKS runs the Kubernetes management infrastructure across multiple AWS availability zones to eliminate a single point of failure. Benefits include Zero-Downtime, Rolling Deployment, IAM to RBAC mapping, Auto Scaling, IAM roles for Pods, Deploying Helm securely with automated TLS certificate management, and Heterogeneous Worker Groups. Auto Scaling Users can automatically adjust the capacity of the number of compute resources allocated to their applications and maintain steady, predictable performance, depending on the requirements. Advantages include the seamless availability of new instances during demand spikes and automatic decrease during demand drops. Security Users can include a collection of security best practices for managing secrets, credentials, and servers. Includes streamlined support for CloudTrail, KMS, SSH key management via IAM, IAM Groups, fail2ban, NTP, and OS hardening. Distributed Cache A data cache can be configured to span multiple servers, storing common requests and enabling quick retrieval. Amazon ElastiCache offers fully managed Redis and Memcached. Seamlessly deploy, run, and scale popular open source compatible in-memory data stores. Build data-intensive apps or improve the performance of your existing apps by retrieving data from high throughput and low latency in-memory data stores. MongoDB Cluster Users can deploy a MongoDB cluster, including replica sets, sharding, an automated bootstrapping process, backup, recovery, and OS optimizations. Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana This module includes support to deploy separate Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana clusters, each with automated zero-downtime rolling deployment, automatic recovery of failed servers, and security groups and IAM policy configuration.

OpenVPN Server Users can deploy an OpenVPN server and manage user accounts using Identity and Access Management (IAM) groups. Includes automatic install and configuration of a high-availability OpenVPN server, public key infrastructure (PKI), data backup, IAM policies, security groups, and cross-platform apps to automatically request and revoke credentials. TICK Stack TICK Stack is based on the push model of collecting data. A set of open source components \u2013 Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf, Kapacitor \u2013 collectively deliver a platform to store, capture, monitor and visualize data. Telegraf, a plugin-driven server agent, is used to collect and report metrics. InfluxDB is a high-performance time-series database in order to manage high write and query loads. Chronograph, the user interface and visualization engine of the platform allows for easy monitoring and alerting of the infrastructure. Kapacitor, a data processing engine, can process both stream and batch data from InfluxDB. DC/OS Stacks DC/OS (the Distributed Cloud Operating System) is an open-source, distributed operating system based on the Apache Mesos distributed systems kernel. DC/OS manages multiple machines in the cloud or on-premises from a single interface; deploys containers, distributed services, and legacy applications into those machines; and provides networking, service discovery and resource management to keep the services running and communicating with each other. Amazon ECS Docker Cluster Amazon Elastic Container Service allows users to run Docker applications on a scalable cluster. This eliminates the need for users to install and operate your own container orchestration software, manage and scale a cluster of virtual machines, or schedule containers on those virtual machines. Value Proposition From the initial development step, we adopt automation in the infrastructure. We allow you to submit the deliveries with greater consistency, eliminating Human error, and supporting task repeatability. Building a secure infrastructure with snowflake configurations comprising the metal servers will avoid the effect in hardware or software requirements, case-by-case manual handling. Automation dramatically replaces the manual efforts, reduces the time taken to deploy thousands of servers, eliminating the snowflakes and configuration, and drift errors. Why Us We provide test-free deliveries for clients that remain unchanged for the majority of the OS flavors. We also offer end-to-end support for the applications that we develop. Apart from this, we provide testing in the cloud environment with the entire modules that can develop in it. Day 1 Advantage As we have the expertise level in providing viable Products / Applications, we can hand over the earlier draft with required functionalities.

    "text": "Infrastructure Automation \u2013 ScriptBees Infrastructure Automation Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process where infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) managed with code and software development techniques such as version control and continuous integration. IaC is necessary for regular DevOps practices and used in conjunction with Continuous Delivery. IaC allows DevOps teams to test applications in production-like environments early on in the development cycle. The developers, and system administrators as well, interact with infrastructure methodically, and at a scale, rather than manually setting up and configuring resources with cloud\u2019s API model help. Engineers can, therefore, interface with infrastructure with code-based tools to help and treat both infrastructure and application code similarly. Infrastructure and servers can now be deployed swiftly with standardized patterns, updated with the latest patches/versions, or duplicated in repeatable ways. Infrastructure Modules Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) enables users to provide an isolated sector of a public cloud network, thereby creating a private virtual network over which they have complete control. Users will have complete control over private IP addresses, creating subnets, in addition to configuring route tables and network gateways. Other benefits include Disaster Recovery, Multiple Connectivity Options, Secured Features, Extend their Datacenter to Cloud, Network Topologies, and Hybrid Applications among others. Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) allows users to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications easily, using Kubernetes on AWS. Amazon EKS runs the Kubernetes management infrastructure across multiple AWS availability zones to eliminate a single point of failure. Benefits include Zero-Downtime, Rolling Deployment, IAM to RBAC mapping, Auto Scaling, IAM roles for Pods, Deploying Helm securely with automated TLS certificate management, and Heterogeneous Worker Groups. Auto Scaling Users can automatically adjust the capacity of the number of compute resources allocated to their applications and maintain steady, predictable performance, depending on the requirements. Advantages include the seamless availability of new instances during demand spikes and automatic decrease during demand drops. Security Users can include a collection of security best practices for managing secrets, credentials, and servers. Includes streamlined support for CloudTrail, KMS, SSH key management via IAM, IAM Groups, fail2ban, NTP, and OS hardening. Distributed Cache A data cache can be configured to span multiple servers, storing common requests and enabling quick retrieval. Amazon ElastiCache offers fully managed Redis and Memcached. Seamlessly deploy, run, and scale popular open source compatible in-memory data stores. Build data-intensive apps or improve the performance of your existing apps by retrieving data from high throughput and low latency in-memory data stores. MongoDB Cluster Users can deploy a MongoDB cluster, including replica sets, sharding, an automated bootstrapping process, backup, recovery, and OS optimizations. Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana This module includes support to deploy separate Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana clusters, each with automated zero-downtime rolling deployment, automatic recovery of failed servers, and security groups and IAM policy configuration. It also contains scripts for setting up Filebeat and CollectD on an application server to ship off logs and"

It also contains scripts for setting up Filebeat and CollectD on an application server to ship off logs and machine metrics to Elasticsearch. OpenVPN Server Users can deploy an OpenVPN server and manage user accounts using Identity and Access Management (IAM) groups. Includes automatic install and configuration of a high-availability OpenVPN server, public key infrastructure (PKI), data backup, IAM policies, security groups, and cross-platform apps to automatically request and revoke credentials. TICK Stack TICK Stack is based on the push model of collecting data. A set of open source components \u2013 Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf, Kapacitor \u2013 collectively deliver a platform to store, capture, monitor and visualize data. Telegraf, a plugin-driven server agent, is used to collect and report metrics. InfluxDB is a high-performance time-series database in order to manage high write and query loads. Chronograph, the user interface and visualization engine of the platform allows for easy monitoring and alerting of the infrastructure. Kapacitor, a data processing engine, can process both stream and batch data from InfluxDB. DC/OS Stacks DC/OS (the Distributed Cloud Operating System) is an open-source, distributed operating system based on the Apache Mesos distributed systems kernel. DC/OS manages multiple machines in the cloud or on-premises from a single interface; deploys containers, distributed services, and legacy applications into those machines; and provides networking, service discovery and resource management to keep the services running and communicating with each other. Amazon ECS Docker Cluster Amazon Elastic Container Service allows users to run Docker applications on a scalable cluster. This eliminates the need for users to install and operate your own container orchestration software, manage and scale a cluster of virtual machines, or schedule containers on those virtual machines. Value Proposition From the initial development step, we adopt automation in the infrastructure. We allow you to submit the deliveries with greater consistency, eliminating Human error, and supporting task repeatability. Building a secure infrastructure with snowflake configurations comprising the metal servers will avoid the effect in hardware or software requirements, case-by-case manual handling.

Assignments such as data entry in CRM systems, automated invoicing, text recognition, and more. The key elements of RPA can be found in the abbreviation. R \u2014 Robotic Robotics defines the special algorithm or a software bot that can execute any task. Similar to industrial robots, RPA bots follow predetermined rules to emulate user interactions. For example, distributing incoming support tickets between the support team. P \u2014 Process Process defines the sequence of steps for any task to be accomplished. For example, a support manager needs to handle different types of incoming inquiries and respond to them based on their request. Providing the same information for common inquiries requires extra resources and attention to ensure successful customers.
